#Troubleshooting

## Step 1: Turn on debug mode.

*Be sure to revert these changes once the error is fixed!*

## Step 2: Reproduce the issue.


## Step 3: Collect information.

If it looks like you're going to need help solving the problem, it's time to get serious about collecting data. Look for error messages or other information about the problem in the following places: 

- Displayed on the actual page
- Displayed in the browser console
- Recorded in the server's error log

Copy any messages to a text file and jot down a few notes about *when* the error occurred, *what* you were doing at the time, and so on. Be sure to include any insights you may have gleaned about the conditions under which the issue does and doesn't occur. Add as much information as possible about your server environment: OS version, web server version, PHP version and handler, et cetera.

## Step 4: Prepare a report.
